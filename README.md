`Tcramer` writes rake tasks!

## Installation

Add this line to your project's Gemfile:

    gem 'tcramer'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tcramer

## Usage

First, run the installation generator:

    $ rails g tcramer:install

This will write a new, mission-critical rake task into your project called `manage.rake`. You can now invoke the `Tcramer` management task by running:

    $ rake manage

Another rake task that will deliver a sharp shot in the arm to your organization is written to `motivate.rake`. You too can be motivated to exceed performance expectations, thanks to `Tcramer`, by running:

    $ rake motivate
